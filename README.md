## Java Spring Boot

Java Spring Boot is a powerful and widely-used framework for building robust and scalable web applications. Some of the key features and benefits of Spring Boot include:

- **Rapid Development:** Spring Boot simplifies application setup and development, reducing boilerplate code and configuration.
- **Embedded Web Server:** Spring Boot includes an embedded web server (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty) for running applications without external dependencies.
- **Dependency Management:** Manage project dependencies effortlessly with Spring Boot's built-in dependency management tool.
- **Auto-Configuration:** Spring Boot offers intelligent auto-configuration based on the application's classpath and properties.
- **Security:** Implement security measures easily with Spring Security, ensuring secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Spring Data:** Integrate data access seamlessly with Spring Data, supporting various databases and data sources.
- **Microservices Support:** Spring Boot is well-suited for building microservices architectures due to its modularity and flexibility.
